Todo:

- Responsive grid items should have max width and be a little narrower on the big screen
- Description (maybe as a popup)
- Expand/contract calendar
- Validate hours
- Validate activity name
- Clean up dialogs
- fix scroll bars looking ugly
- blue grey theme
- change calendar icon color (green maybe)

Maybe:

- Don't allow overlapping calendar events
- Alt + drag to copy?
- Saner state objects?
- Fix the useEffect hook for delete key
